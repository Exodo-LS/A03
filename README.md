### Part 1 Installation of Github, Webstorm, and Git:

***
### Part 2 Defining Words:

* **Branch** - A branch is a parallel version of a repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch
* **Clone** - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.
* **Commit** - It is an individual change to a file or set of files (also known as a revision).
* **Fetch** - Adds changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.
* **GIT** - It is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.
* **Github** - It is where over 65 million developers shape the future of software, together. (Yes that is the website bio)
* **Merge** - Takes the changes from one branch and applies them into another. (Branches must be in the same repository)
* **Merge Conflict** - A difference that occurs between merged branches. Can happen when people make different changes to the same line of the file or when one person makes changes while another deletes the same file. Must be resolved before merging.
* **Push** - To send your committed changes to a remote repository.
* **Pull** - The act of fetching changes and merging them.
* **Remote** - This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server.
* **Repository** - The folder where your projects are stored.
